\usage{
prepareData(data, nPops, filter = FALSE, threshold = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{is a list with four different entries. The entries should be
named as "rMajor", "rMinor", "coverage" and "info". The \code{rMajor} entry
should be a matrix containing the number of observed major-allele reads.
The \code{rMinor} entry should be a matrix containing the number of
observed minor-allele reads. The \code{coverage} entry should be a matrix
containing the total depth of coverage. The \code{info} entry should be a
matrix or a data frame containing the remaining relevant information, such
as the contig name and the position of each SNP. Each row of these matrices
should be a different site and each column should be a different
population.}

\item{nPops}{is an integer indicating the total number of different
populations in the dataset.}

\item{filter}{is a logical switch, either TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE, then the
data is filtered by the frequency of the minor allele and if FALSE, that
filter is not applied.}

\item{threshold}{is the minimum allowed frequency for the minor allele. Sites
where the allelic frequency is below this threshold are removed from the
data.}
}
\value{
a list with six named entries:

\item{freqs}{a list with the allele frequencies, computed by dividing the
number of minor-allele reads by the total coverage. Each entry of this list
corresponds to a different contig. Each entry is a matrix where each row is
a different site and each column is a different population.}

\item{positions}{a list with the positions of each SNP. Each entry of this
list is a vector corresponding to a different contig.}

\item{range}{a list with the minimum and maximum SNP position of each
contig. Each entry of this list is a vector corresponding to a different
contig.}

\item{rMajor}{a list with the number of major-allele reads. Each entry of
this list corresponds to a different contig. Each entry is a matrix where
each row is a different site and each column is a different population.}

\item{rMinor}{a list with the number of minor-allele reads. Each entry of
this list corresponds to a different contig. Each entry is a matrix where
each row is a different site and each column is a different population.}

\item{coverage}{a list with the total coverage. Each entry of this list
corresponds to a different contig. Each entry is a matrix where each row is
a different site and each column is a different population.}
}
\description{
Organize the information of multiple _rc files into different entries for
each contig.
}
\details{
This function removes all monomorphic sites from the dataset. Monomorphic
sites are those where the frequency for all populations is 1 or 0. Then, the
name of each contig is used to organize the information in a per contig
basis. Thus, each output will be organized by contig. For example, the list
with the number of minor-allele reads will contain several entries and each
of those entries is a different contig.

If the filter input is set to TRUE, this function also filters the data by
the frequency of the minor-allele. If a threshold is supplied, the computed
frequency is compared to that threshold and sites where the frequency is
below the threshold are removed from the dataset. If no threshold is
supplied, the threshold is assumed to be \code{1/total coverage}, meaning
that a site should have, at least, one minor-allele read.
